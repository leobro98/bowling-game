Library implementing the logic of the Bowling game

This is the result of acomplishing of the test assignment which can be found in the Bowling_assignment.txt file. This is the Maven project producing the jar with the game logic. The entry point to the library is the Game class. The library can be used to display the list of players and the score table for all players, to display the currently active player and to register the result of the current roll of the bowl.

The possible setup of the whole bowling system can include:

1. A hardware producing an event with number of pins fallen after each roll of the bowl,
2. A graphical user interface receiving the events from the hardware and using this library for getting data to be displayed,
3. The present library implementing the game logic.
